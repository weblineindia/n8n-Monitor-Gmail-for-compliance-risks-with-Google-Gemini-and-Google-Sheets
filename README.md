# AI-Powered Email Monitoring & Compliance Risk Detection

> Gmail + Gemini + Google Sheets

---

This workflow automatically monitors incoming Gmail messages, analyzes them using Google Gemini AI for compliance risks (fraud, phishing, data leaks), filters high-confidence threats, logs incidents securely in Google Sheets and sends alert emails to your security team.

### Quick Implementation Steps

1. Connect your **Gmail** and **Google Sheets** accounts.
2. Add your **Google Gemini API credentials**.
3. Set the Gmail node to monitor your desired inbox.
4. Create a Google Sheet with required columns:
   - `Incident_Hash`
   - `Incident_Time`
   - `Risk_Type`
   - `Risk_Confidence`
5. Replace the alert email in the final Gmail node.
6. [Activate the workflow](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/om1efg2qgvwi).

That's it — your AI-powered compliance monitoring system is live!

## What It Does

This workflow acts as an intelligent email security and compliance monitoring system. It continuously scans incoming emails and uses AI to detect potential risks such as fraud attempts, phishing emails or sensitive data leaks.

When an email arrives, the system extracts clean text by removing HTML clutter, signatures and hidden elements. This ensures that only relevant content is sent to the AI model, improving both accuracy and cost efficiency.

The workflow then leverages Google Gemini to analyze the email in its original language, eliminating the need for translation. The AI returns a structured JSON response including risk type, severity level, confidence score and reasoning.

To ensure reliability, a custom code node safely parses the AI output using regex and error handling. Based on the detected risk level, the workflow routes the email, filters out low-confidence alerts, logs incidents securely and sends formatted alerts to your compliance or security team.

## Who It's For

- Compliance teams monitoring sensitive communications
- Security teams handling phishing and fraud detection
- Enterprises managing high-volume email workflows
- Customer support teams dealing with external communications
- Organizations requiring audit trails for regulatory compliance

## Requirements

To use this workflow, you need:

- [n8n account (Cloud or Self-hosted)](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/om1efg2qgvwi)
- Google account with:
  - Gmail access
  - Google Sheets access
- Google Gemini API credentials
- A Google Sheet for logging incidents
- Basic understanding of n8n workflows

## How It Works & How To Set Up

### 1. Setup Credentials

- Connect **Gmail OAuth2** in n8n
- Connect **Google Sheets OAuth2**
- Add **Google Gemini API credentials**

### 2. Configure Gmail Trigger

- Node: **Catch Incoming Emails**
- Operation: `getAll`
- Set filters if needed (label, inbox, etc.)

### 3. Clean Email Content

- Node: **Strip Email Formatting**
- Extracts `<body>` content from HTML
- Outputs clean text as `clean_body`

### 4. AI Risk Analysis

- Node: **Analyze Compliance Risk**
- Uses Google Gemini to analyze:
  - Subject
  - Email body
- Returns structured JSON:

```json
{
  "risk_type": "",
  "risk_level": "",
  "confidence": 0,
  "reason": ""
}
```

### 5. Safe Parsing (Critical Step)

- Node: **Clean & Parse AI Output**
- Uses:
  - Regex to extract JSON
  - try/catch for error handling
- Prevents workflow failure if AI output is malformed

### 6. Prepare Variables

- Node: **Prep Variables for Routing**
- Extracts:
  - `risk_type`
  - `risk_level`
  - `confidence`
  - `reason`

### 7. Route Based on Risk

- Node: **Route by Risk Level**
- Splits into:
  - High
  - Medium
  - Low

### 8. Filter False Positives

- Node: **Block Low-Confidence Alerts**
- Condition:

  ```
  confidence > 80
  ```

- Ensures only high-confidence threats proceed

### 9. Generate Secure Incident ID

- Node: **Generate Secure Incident ID**
- Uses SHA256 hash of:
  - Sender email
  - Timestamp
- Masks sensitive data (PII)

### 10. Log to Google Sheets

- Node: **Save to Audit Log**
- Appends data:
  - `Incident_Hash`
  - `Incident_Time`
  - `Risk_Type`
  - `Risk_Confidence`

### 11. Format Report

- Node: **Format AI Report**
- Converts AI reasoning (Markdown → HTML)

### 12. Send Alert

- Node: **Send Security Alert**
- Sends styled HTML email to your team
- Replace:

```
REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_EMAIL
```

## How To Customize Nodes

### Adjust AI Prompt

- Modify the prompt in **Analyze Compliance Risk**
- Add custom risk categories or rules

### Change Confidence Threshold

- Update filter node (default: `> 80`)
- Lower for aggressive detection, higher for stricter filtering

### Customize Alert Email

- Edit HTML in **Send Security Alert**
- Add branding, logos or additional data

### Modify Logging Fields

- Extend Google Sheets columns
- Add fields like:
  - Sender
  - Subject
  - Department

## Add-Ons (Extend Functionality)

- Slack / Microsoft Teams alerts instead of email
- Dashboard using Power BI or Looker Studio
- Auto-response to suspicious emails
- Integration with SIEM tools
- Store historical data for ML-based trend analysis

## Use Case Examples

1. Detect phishing emails targeting employees
2. Monitor customer support inbox for fraud attempts
3. Identify accidental data leaks in outgoing communications
4. Automate compliance monitoring for regulated industries
5. Flag suspicious vendor or financial emails

And many more use cases depending on your business needs.

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| No emails detected | Gmail trigger not configured | Check Gmail credentials and filters |
| AI output parsing fails | Invalid JSON from AI | Verify Code node logic and prompt format |
| Alerts not sent | Email not configured | Replace recipient email in final node |
| No data in Google Sheets | Sheet mapping incorrect | Verify document ID and column names |
| Too many false alerts | Low confidence threshold | Increase threshold above 80 |
| Workflow crashes | Missing credentials | Reconnect all services |
